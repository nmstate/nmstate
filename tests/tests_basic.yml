# empty playbook to gather facts for import_playbook when clause
- hosts: all

# workaround for: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/27973
# There is no way in Ansible to abort a playbook for host that do not run RHEL
# 7 or CentOS 7 without failing the playbook. Therefore we include the playbook
# with the tests only if the hosts would support it. There will need to be a
# way to skip RHEL 6 hosts from running the tests since there is no Network
# Manager
