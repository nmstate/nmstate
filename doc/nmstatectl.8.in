.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nmstatectl\fR is created for users who want to try out nmstate without using
\fIlibnmstate\fR.
.PP
.B show
.RS
Query the current network state. \fIYAML\fR is the default output format. Use
the \fB--json\fR argument to change the output format to \fIJSON\fR. To limit
the output state to include certain interfaces only, please specify the
interface name. Please be advised, global config like DNS will be included.
.PP
For multiple interface names, use comma to separate them. You can also use
patterns for interface names:
.RS
.B *\fR matches everything
.br
.B ?\fR matches any single character
.br
.B [seq]\fR matches any character in seq
.br
.B [!seq]\fR matches any character not in seq
.RE
.PP
For example, to show all interfaces starts with eth:
.RS
nmstatectl show eth\\*
.br
# The backslash is required to stop shell expanding '*' to file names.

.PP
.B set
.RS
"Set" command is deprecated. Please consider using "apply" instead.

Apply the network state from specified file in \fIYAML\fR or \fIJSON\fR format.
By default, if the network state after state applied is not identical to the
desired state, \fBnmstatectl\fR rollbacks to the state before \fBset\fR
command. Use the \fB--no-verify\fR argument to skip the verification.
.RE
.PP
.B apply
.RS
Apply the network state from specified file in \fIYAML\fR or \fIJSON\fR format.
By default, if the network state after state applied is not identical to the
desired state, \fBnmstatectl\fR rollbacks to the state before \fBset\fR
command. Use the \fB--no-verify\fR argument to skip the verification.
.RE
.PP
.B edit
.RS
.B nmstatectl\fR will invoke the text editor defined by environment variable
\fIEDITOR\fR for editing the network state in \fIYAML\fR format. Once the text
editor quit, \fBnmstatectl\fR will try to apply it using \fB"nmstatectl set"\fR.
.br
If there is any syntax error, you will be asked to edit again. Multiple
interfaces are supported, check \fIshow\fR for detail.
.PP
By default, if the network state after state applied is not identical to the
desired state, \fBnmstatectl\fR rollbacks to the state before \fBedit\fR
command. Use the \fB--no-verify\fR argument to skip the verification.
.RE
.PP
.B nmstatectl\fR supports manual transaction control which allows user to
decide whether rollback to previous (before \fB"nmstatectl set/edit"\fR) state.
.IP \fBrollback
rollback the network state from specified checkpoint file. \fBnmstatectl\fR
will take the latest checkpoint if not defined as argument.
.PP

.B gc

.RS
Generates configuration files for specified network state file(s). The output
will be dictinary with plugin name as key and an tuple as value.
The tuple will holding configuration file name and configuration content.

The generated configuration is not saved into system, users have to do it
by themselves after refering to the network backend.
.RE

.B commit
.RS
commit the current network state. \fBnmstatectl\fR will take the latest
checkpoint if not defined as argument.
.RE
.B version
.RS
displays nmstate version.
.RE
.PP
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.B --json
.RS
change the output format to \fIJSON\fR.
.RE

.B -r, --running-config
.RS
Showing the running network configuration.
.RE

.B -s, --show-secrets
.RS
Showing with the secrets. By default, nmstate is masking the passwords by
\fI<_password_hid_by_nmstate>\fR.
.RE

.IP \fB--no-verify
skip the desired network state verification.
.IP \fB--no-commit
create a checkpoint which later could be used for rollback or commit. The
checkpoint will be the last line of \fBnmstatectl\fR output, example:
\fI/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Checkpoint/1\fR.
.IP \fB--memory-only
all the changes done will be non persistent, they are going to be removed after
rebooting.
.IP \fB--timeout\fR=<\fITIMEOUT\fR>
the user must commit the changes within \fItimeout\fR, or they will be
automatically rolled back. Default: 60 seconds.
.IP \fB--version
displays nmstate version.
.SH LIMITATIONS
*\fR Maximum supported number of interfaces in a single desire state is 1000.
