.SH NAME
nmstate-autoconf \- A nmstate command line tool to automatically configure the
network state using LLDP information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nmstate-autoconf \fR[\fIINTERFACE_NAME\fR] [\fB--dry-run\fR]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nmstate-autoconf\fR is a command line tool that uses \fIlibnmstate\fR in order to
confgure the network state automatically using LLDP information. This tool is
experimental only.

\fInmstate-autoconf\fR will identify the interfaces connected to a VLAN and
unify them in a bond interface.  In addition, a vlan interface will be created
in top of the bond.

The bond state will be the following one:

- name: bond50
  type: bond
  state: up
  link-aggregation:
    mode: balance-rr
    port:
    - enp4s0
    - enp4s0d1

The host VLAN state will be the following one:

- name: prod-net
  type: vlan
  state: up
  vlan:
    base-iface: bond50
    id: 50

.PP
For multiple interface names, use comma to separate them. You can also use
patterns for interface names:
.RS
.B *\fR matches everything
.br
.B ?\fR matches any single character
.br
.B [seq]\fR matches any character in seq
.br
.B [!seq]\fR matches any character not in seq
.RE
.PP
For example, to enable LLDP auto configuration on all interfaces starts with
eth:
.RS
nmstate-autoconf eth\\*
.br
# The backslash is required to stop shell expanding '*' to file names.
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.B --dry-run, -d
.RS
Generate the network state that is going to be applied and print it out. It
won't apply any changes in the host.
.RE
.SH LIMITATIONS
*\fR This tool is experimental only.
*\fR It is not possible to configure automatically bond or vlan options.
