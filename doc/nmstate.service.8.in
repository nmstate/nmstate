nmstate\&.service
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
nmstate\&.service invokes \fBnmstatectl service\fR command which
apply all network state files ending with \fB.yml\fR in
\fB/etc/nmstate\fR folder.
By default, the network state file will be renamed with the suffix
\fB.applied\fR after applying it. This is to prevent it being applied again
when the service runs next.

With \fB/etc/nmstate/nmstate.conf\fR holding below content:

\fB
[service]
keep_state_file_after_apply = true
\fR

The nmstate.service will not remove network state file, just copy applied
network stata to file with the suffix \fB.applied\fR after applying it.
